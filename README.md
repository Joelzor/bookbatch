# Bookbatch

Bookbatch is my final, full-stack project in Boolean. Bookbatch is an application inspired by fivebooks and book swapping apps that will allow users to create ‘batches’, or collections of books linked by theme or genre or any other link through customisable tags. The user is then able to write a post/essay explaining the connection between the books. 

For example, a user might want to write an introduction to one of their favourite authors- they can search for the books and see the covers displayed in a list. Then, they can add their chosen tags and write a post explaining what ties the batch together.

The user can visit a homepage where the concept is explained with example batches. They will then be able to sign up and customise their profile. From here, they will be able to create their own batch. On the ‘create’ page, they can search for books and add them to a list, add tags, then write their post explaining the collection.
